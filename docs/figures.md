![Overlapping census block groups (CBGs) and HOLC neighborhoods for
	Evansville, Indiana as an example of how we assign broadband
	access measures to HOLC neighborhood grades. Because CBGs (A) and
	HOLC neighborhood boundaries (B) do not perfectly align (C), we
	perform an intersecting spatial join (D) and use overlapping areas
	as weights to compute HOLC neighborhood FCC-derived broadband
	access averages. When using ACS-derived measures, we perform a
	similar procedure using census
	tracts.](holc_overlap.pdf){#fig:process}

	values with 95% credible intervals shown in the shaded

    group. Each bar represents the within-group percentage of persons
    who live within a HOLC neighborhood grade classification; the
    numbers in parentheses are the relative percentage of each group
    out of the total sample. _AI/AK_: American Indian / Alaska Native;
